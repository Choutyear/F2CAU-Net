F^{2}CAU-Net model architecture. We introduce fuzzy convolution modules (blue rectangles) to enhance the convolutional neural networkâ€™s ability to model fuzzy boundaries and regions. In addition, a fuzzy attention mechanism (purple rectangle) is incorporated into the skip connection to optimize the segmentation results.
